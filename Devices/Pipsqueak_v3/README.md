# Pipsqueak Version 3

This, the current Pipsqueak hardware version, is designed with the intent of being
able to replace the controller in SS Brewtech's FTSS system. As such, it handles
peripheral currents up to 7 amps and main current up to 8 amps. An onboard
temperature sensor is added to monitor for overheating, and the duty cycle is
intended to be modest.
